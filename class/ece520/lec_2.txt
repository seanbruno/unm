- MOSFET
-- SiO is super cheap, super easy to use
-- N_type vs P_type
--- Adding electrons vs comsuming electrons
--- N_d = Phosphorus (N_Type, depetion, extra electrons)
--- N_D = atoms/cm^3
--- n_i = 10^10
--- n_i = 10^15 -> 10^19
-- N_A = Boron (acceptor, holes)
--- N_A = 10^15 -> 10^19

-- PN Junction
-- [N] | [P]
--- diffusion will cause electron flow from N to P
---- "holes" will flow from P to N
-- [N] |-|-| [P]
--- Junction will begin to cause flow to slow as negative and positve charge balance.
--- depletion region in the center acts as an insulator and no longer has free electrons or holes.
--- Applying a negative voltage to N side causes flow
--- Applying a postive voltage to P side causes something or other.

-- [[[[]]]]] -- metal
--------------- insulator
\-------------\ depletion region expands with more positve voltage
eeeeeeeeeeeeeee layer of electrons form as pulled from ground at certain point



--------------- P-type connected to ground

As Voltage increases positive voltage repels holes and increase depletion region
At a certain point the bottom layer of the metal will become an N-type and insulator region will stop growning.

n_i will fluctuate with temperatur in pure Si.  Doped Si will fluctuate much less.

-- Now we talk about "Threshold Voltage" -- the voltage at which starts the formation of inversion layer. V_t


     -- [[[[]]]]] -- metal
     --------------- insulator
N+[]\-------------\[]N+ highly doped side areas in the junction
-----              ------ insulator region


     --------------- P-type connected to ground

--  At threshold voltage, N-type forms and allows the current to flow from the two sides.  It becomes a switch. A MOSFET.

-- Because the channel is N-type (p-type substrate) its an NMOS
-- If the channel is P-Type (n-type substrate) its an PMOS

NMOS

PMOS

If both are used, its a CMOS.  

NMOS drain is always higher potential than source.
PMOS source is always higher potetntial than drain.
