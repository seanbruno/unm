- Neuromorphic Computing
-- Neural Network design and layout

-- homework - even/odd increment and display weights (10 bit input), output 1 bit
- each neuron is different
-- even odd
-- less than a number
-- binning/value detection

- memristor based adjustments (not permitted in eFabless)
-- allows adjustment of inputs to comparitor.

- don't use NVRam
- Weights can be stored via SRAM (preferred).

-
- digital/analog mix

-- project
 - phase 1
 -- concept phase
 - phase 2
 -- Schematic drawing
 -- SPICE sim
 - phase 3
 -- Layout
 -- SPICE again

-- serial input, clock, diag/debug

Project 1:
- ID lead member for scheduling and submissions
- each member has a definitive part and participation
- who is handling what parts
- each subsequent report has individual write ups
- due 29th
