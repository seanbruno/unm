-- Cut off (V_gs < V_t) I_ds = 0
-- Linear ( V_ds < V_gs - V_t) I_ds = K`n (W/L) [V_ds - V_t)V_ds - V_ds^2/2]
-- Saturation (V_ds > V_gs - V_t) i_ds = K`n (W/L) [V_gs - V_t)^2

-- Body Effect (Bulk is not tied to source/ground)

-- Threshold Voltage (slide 3/4 of slide deck 3)
-- Trapped holes/electrons will affect the treshold voltage such that it can be easier/harder to meet the threshold.

-- Consult pictures.  You are in big trouble.

-- If too much implant of Ntype to a NMOS, it can end up with negative V_t and the gate will always be on, and you have to increase the gate voltage.  "Can V_t < 0?" yes.  This is a depletion mode device.

-- For PMOS/Ptype this is an enhancement mode device.

-- The symbol will be the same as a normal transitor except it shows the depletion region below the gate/bulk.

-- V_t0 is shown in Spice tools as when the V_sb = 0

-- See slide 4/17
-- In NMOS - the bulk potential has to be lower than source
           - the body effect increases threshold voltage

-- In PMOS - the bulk potential has to be higher than source
           - the body effect increases V_t (abs val )
