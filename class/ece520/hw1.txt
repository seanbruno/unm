1. In order to estimate the fabrication cost, we need to determine the number of dies
in a wafer. Prove the equations in slide 61 of Lecture 1. Then, use the equations in
the slide to determine the percentage of wasted silicon (due to the edge of the
wafer), as a function of die size. Plot the % wasted area as a function of die size for
die sizes from 1 Cm to 5 Cm in an 8-inch wafer.

2. In this problem, we would like to derive the equation for drain current in saturation
region considering channel-length modulation. Assume that the change in channel
length is proportional to VDS (i.e., ∆L/L=λVDS). Show how equation (3.29) in your
textbook becomes (3.30) when you include channel length modulation.


3. Based on the list of previous VLSI projects for ECE520/424 that we discussed in
Lecture 1, please suggest at least one new project that you will be interested in
designing and working on during this semester. Please explain how you design
your suggested project. Feel free to use online resources, for example
