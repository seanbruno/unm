- PUF Statiscal Metrics for Randomness
-- Freq Test
--- Count number of '1' in a bitstring and measures how close it is to 50% of the string
-- Block Freq test
--- 
-- runs Test
--- look at total runs, measure speed of change between 1 and 0
-- Longest Run Time
--- look at longest run
-- Rank Test
--- look at linear indendance between fixed length substrings
-- Fourier Transform Test
--- look at freq spectrum of the bitstring and test for periodic features or any repeats close to each other
-- Non-Overlapping and Overlapping Template Test
--- check some amount of the bitsring for a repeat of a pre determined bit string to ensure the same amount of occurences
-- Universal Test
-- linear complexit test
-- serial/approximate entropy test
-- cumulative sums test
-- random excursion test
