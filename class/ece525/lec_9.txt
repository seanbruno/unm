-- PUF Construction
--- Exploits the imperfections/defects of circutis and ICs in fabrication
--- Read MAES txt
--- Reliability, randomness, uniqueness
---- Puf Class
---- Puf Instance
---- Puf Evaluation
--- Puf Construction II
---- uniqueness, randomness, reliability
--- Puf Stats metric for Reliability
---- every use of PUF will be slightly different
---- almost every PUF needs helper data to mark unreliable bits or assist in cleanup of bitstream
--- Puf Stats Metrics for Relaiblity
---- provisioning vs enrollment vs regeneration
---- provisioning 
----- generate the helper data
---- enrollment
----- first time secret generate = helper data + PUF
---- regeneration
----- generate response = helper data + secret message
