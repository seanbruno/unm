- NIST test suite for Randomness
-- Nist finalAnalysisReport using HELP ASIG
- Weak PUF vs Strong PUF
-- Strong means that you can give it to someone for a long time and it still possible to generate a response that an advesary can't know.
-- PUF has a large challenge space
-- can't build a model of the PUF
-- Anything else is WEAK.
- PUF Usage Scenarios
-- Identification
--- Unique Serial number (Intel Loftstrum)
--- Weak PUF
-- Authentication
--- needs a strong PUF
--- needs a non-repeatable challenge/response each time.
--- PUF input/output are exposed.  Leads to model-building via acessible endpoints/data.
--- PUF auth can eliminate NVM for key stores
--- can provide large number of CRP
--- tamper-evident if they are messed with
--- can be made to never reveal secret even by vendor/manufacturer
--- stronger form of CRP
-- Encryption
--- Can generate a symmetric key algo
--- random NONCE for specific pub/priv key pair for asym encryption
--- Can be a weak PUF as key is not revealed
--- inaccessable PUF is model-building impossible without access to the power system to record data during operation.
--- tolerance to bit flip errors is 0
-- PUF Implementation
--- Delay-Based PUF
---- Delay along matched patchs
---- Ring Oscillator fewuencies
---- Glitches along paths
---- Delays along glitch free path
--- Bi-stable PUF
---- SRAM
---- Butterfuly, Buskeepers
---- FlipFlopss and LAtches
--- Mixed-Signal PUF
---- Transistor threshold voltage/transconductance
---- Dynamic/leakage current
---- REsistance/Capacitance
--- Arbiter PUF
