-- ML Flavors: supervised, un-supervised, reinforcement learning
--- FeedForward NEural Networks
---- connection/neurons always forward output in one direction
--- Back propagation algorigthm
---- gradient descent utilzing derivitive to push results backwards
--- Recurrent Neural Network
---- FFN doesn't know what happened in the past, no storage
---- RNN will know about last event when processing current event
--- Long Short-term Memory
---- learns temporal relations but not spatial correlations
---- an RNN that can learn long-term dependencies.
--- Convolutional LSTM
--- Remote Sensing with LEO Satellites
---- DL based nonlinear predictive coding
---- compression based on ML to xfer less data
