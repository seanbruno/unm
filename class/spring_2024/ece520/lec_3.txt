- Current example:

K'_n = 100uF
(w/L) = 10
V_t = 1

Identify S, D and G

Reverse bias on drain will lead to larger depletion region on the Drain.

Pinch off happens at VG_S - V_T

Current levels off at pinch off

Channel lenght modulation slide 43

Transistor in 3 conditions:
- V_GS < V_t yeilds I_DS = 0
- V_GS > V_t and V_DS < V_GS - V_t yeilds I_DS = K`(W/L)()
- V_DS < V_GS - V_t yelds I_DS = (K`/2)(W/L)(V_GS-V_t)^2(linear adjustment)
-- saturation


In PMOS, all parameters are input negative.  Same formulas/eq as NMOS but the values start negative when they are put in.

In NMOS, Drain is always higher potentional than Source
In NMOS, When Gate is tied to Ground, NMOS is off.
In NMOS, When Gate is tied to VDD, NMOS is on.

In PMOS, Source is always higher potentional than Drain
In PMOS, When Gate is tied to VDD, PMOS is off.
In PMOs, when Gate is tied to Ground, PMOS is on.

Pinchoff point for both will start from the same voltage point.
