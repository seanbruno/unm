-- Review and reset from lecture 4

- Ideal Mosfet
-- Cut off (V_gs < V_t) I_ds = 0
-- Linear ( V_ds < V_gs - V_t) I_ds = K`n (W/L) [V_ds - V_t)V_ds - V_ds^2/2]
-- Saturation (V_ds > V_gs - V_t) i_ds = K`n (W/L) [V_gs - V_t)^2

- Channel len modulation
- Body effect

-- New Material
- Subthreshold Swing (slides lecture4 6-10)

- High V_t have low leakage current
-- low performance (slow switching)
- Low V_t have high leakage current
-- high performance (fast switching)

- Velocity Saturation

L = .6 micron
slide 13
How does graph change at V saturation.
