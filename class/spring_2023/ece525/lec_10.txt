- Puf Constructions
-- uniqueness, randomness, reproducability
-- chips, bits, samples
-- Hardware Reliability 10^-6 errors
--- 10^-9 for Xilinx
-- PUF can protect against bit flips as there is no NVRAM
-- Requires Helper Data to characterize the PUF and eliminate randomness
--- Enrollment is only ever done once (generate helper data)
--- Regeneration is done under different conditions
-- Instra-chip hamming distance is a metric that measures the resiliance of the PUF to changes in environment
--- HD will always use the same challenge in a PUF
--- HD is a measurement of XOR between entrollment and regeneration under a condition (environment)
-- PUF stats metrics for reliability
--- Enrollment typically done at 25C with normal supply voltage
--- Regeneration done at all combinations from 0 to 85F, -5% to +5% voltage
--- generate set of 10 bitstrings
--- generate a mean 
--- generate standard deviation
-- PUF Stats metrics for randomness
--- Randomness is hard to measure
--- Entropy - avg entropy (11110000 == 1)
--- MinEntropy - worst case entropy, preferred meaturements
