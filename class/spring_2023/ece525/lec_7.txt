-- Polyalphabetic Substitution
-- Transposition Ciphers
-- Product Ciphers
--- Claude Shannon 1949
--- How important the secret should determine how much labor spent on the process
--- key/cipher algo should be simply
--- implemenation should be simple
--- Size & storage of C should be restricted and not grossly larger
--- Propagation of errors should be limited
--- Confusion and Diffusion
---- Interceptor cannot predice what will hapen to C when she changes 1 char in P
---- Encryptor with good confusion hides relationship between message + key and cipher text (C)
--- Diffusion (avalanch effect)
---- Avalanche effect (1 bit changes %50 of output bits)
--- Stream and Block cipher (types)
---- Stream Cipher:  continuous stream of cipher bits, no chunked cipher blocks
---- Block Cipher:  encapsulated cipher block (block of message is a block of cipher)
--- AES 128 message text bits
---- cipher text 128 bits out
---- Electonic Code Book (ECB Mode)
