Basis for Proposed Research
Describe the observations/discoveries/achievements (by yourself or others) make you believe that your approach will be successful.

We hypothosize that the research from reference 1 can be made to show immediate results from its simplicity and advances in modern computational resources.  The required additional bidding/auction cycles in the proposed algorythmic changes are achievable with negligible increases to the load and time requirments to the aunctioneer in this model.

In real networks, it will be shown that the losses incurred due to user connectivty issues are minimized.  The multi-round nature of the auction can recover users that may have missed out on a previous round of the auction.  This will have a measurable increase to the number of successful bids during the auction as compared to a single round bid in a standard auction format.

The errors communicating with end users can also be immediately used to track the type and quality of the user during future auctions.  This allows the network to maintain a much more accurate description of each bidder and more accurately award payments to maximize profits for the providers.  The awards and payouts will be directly compared to standard auctions in similar networks to show the expected accuracy gains and efficiencies in payouts.

\section{Research Plan}
\subsection{What methods will be used and why are these most appropriate?}
Initial testing of scenarios will be done internally at the University.  Development of the testing scenarios will require construction of a bid submission agent that will host the auction.  This server will exist on a single machine running the PMMRA example defined in the pseudo code of the paper.  Job submission agents will be developed to submit jobs to the auctioneer server.  These jobs, for initial testing will be requests for some number of digits of PI from some arbitrary positions in the matissa.  User agents that wish to submit themselves for the auction rounds, will submit their bids to the auctioneer.  Results of the auction will proceed via the PMMRA algorithm.  Jobs results will be sent from user agents to the job submission agents which will measure the latency of the job results and issue the payment in the form of arbitrary currency.  To mimic errors and latency during the auction, some amount of errors will be induced via a centralized router in this synthetic test.

Once the initial testing phase is complete, the experimental setup for our scenario will be built out across multiple virtual machine providers (Azure Cloud, Amazon EC2 and Google Compute).  In order to ensure the most thorough testing environment, multiple test instances will be spun up in multiple geographic regious to ensure that some amount of network latency will be randomly injected into the testing scenarious during the auction process.  The auctioneer will still be hosted at the University.  The same criteria will be used to measure the success of the PMMRA.

\subsection{Specific activites (brief descriptions)}
Resource Providers will be utilzing the algorythm in reference 2 in order to generate the arbitrary digits of PI and an arbitary location in the matissa.  This provides an easily portable work function that can easily be verified for accuracy if needed.  This should be written in C and utilize standard libraries available for all systems.

Job Submissions Agents will be written in a similar fashion to the RP.  Additional code will be written to provide an evaluation and feedback on the RP used in each auction result after the work is submitted and returned from the winning RP instances.

The auctioneer will be responsible for implementing the PMMRA from the paper in reference 1 and will be the holder of the payment for the jobs.  Most of the code for this project will be developed for this server application.   The auctioneer will need to be written to

Sean Bruno - sbruno1@unm.edu
28 March 2023 -- ECE 524 Spring Term -- MidTerm Exam

1. (9 %) Consider a cloud computing environment that can provide VMs (virtual machines) and serverless
computing functionalities to the end-users. Each computing functionality comes with a corresponding
unit cost. Based on the end-user’s budget availability, will there be a unique combination of computing
services (i.e., a combination of VMs and serverless computing functionalities) that satisfy its computing
needs? If yes, please explain. If not, please explain. Provide the appropriate network economics
terminology in your answer. (Note: Consider that the end-user’s budget can support the purchase of
multiple product units).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most cases, end-user computing requirements are varied and have a mix of time constraints and data
sizes.  When an end-user considers the computing functionality provided by a service, how quickly they
need results from their provider and how much data they wish to have processed will cause them to
optimize their choices governing which type or style of compute they purchase.

Users who are not time sensitive but are very cost sensitive, will choose the cheaper, serverless option
to maximize their utility from the provider at the cost of slower time to generate a result.  These
users are not going to take advantage of the higher priced, full VM solutions.  Billing departments, 
non-live stream video conversion and large scale genomic analysis do not have a real-time component
needing high speed turn around.  Therefore they can use a much lower cost service.

Users who are very time sensitive will normally need to use services that require higher costs to meet
their scheduling criteria.  These users need to minimize their latency during computation to quickly
return results which providers will charge a much higher cost per unit of CPU.  Full VM providers who
service these requests will have a much higher, dedicated infrastructure to garauntee the latency
requirements from customers whose budgets and workloads demand it.  Live streaming providers who convert
video to multiple codecs in real-time, high-frequency trading analytics engines and voice over IP calling
tend to need low latency providers in order to meet their service level constraints.  These providers
will normally charge a much higher cost to service these types of customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. (9 %) If a frequency band is used in one cell, it cannot be reused in any other cell within a wireless
cellular communication environment. True or False and Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

False: A wireless cell most definitely can use a frequency band that is in use by another cell in multiple types
of wireless communication environment.

Depending on the technique used, frequency bands can be reused in mutiple cells if they are separated by 
large distances such that they don't interfere with each other.  The distance between the cell coverage
can be managed such that individual customers, while using the same frequency bands, won't be able to
interfere with each other.

The same frequency bands are used in CDMA networks where each user is assigned their own modulation 
psuedocode such that the interference of the same frequency is somewhat additive.

It is even possible and desireable to allow the same frequencies to be used across multiple cells in FDMA
networks if the relative use (user population) is low enough that the same bands can be used to service
the area.

Finally, in a network with a random style access protocol (ALOHA), the backoff due to frequency collision
is built into the network.  This would allow the network to utilize the same frequency bands across the
cell network.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. (9 %) Consider a power company within a smart grid system. The energy production cost is fixed.
Yes/No and Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

False:  The cost of energy in a smart grid system is NOT fixed.

Typical smart grid systems have multiple inputs that allow the grid controllers to purchase power at a
variable, market rate depending on consumption and generation.  In a modern smart grid, end users become
power resellers and affect market prices for that power.

During a sunny day, power production via end user electro voltaics become plentiful and cheap.  End user
demand for power is handled via self-generation.  End users will then offload excess power generation to
the grid at whatever market price the power company is paying, causing a downward pressure on the price
per unit of power and making other sources with higher cost become less profitable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. (9 %) Consider a convex maximization problem. What are the necessary conditions in order for the
problem to have a unique global maximum point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of time on this one.  :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. (9 %) What are the two main contract-theoretic models that exist? What is the main characteristic of
each one of those (and at the same time the one that differentiates them)? If you were developing and
owning an online social platform to support crowdsourcing (collect data from the crowd/users), which
model would you choose to reward the users that provide information, e.g., photos, text, video, and why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We studied two contract theory models, namely Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard style solutions.

In Adverse Selection, the principal who needs some work done, has determined via statistical and behavioral
data collection, what types of agents exist to service this work.  Those types can vary, but typically
cover the reliability of the agent and what cost the agent will charge for that work.  The principal can
then use that knowledge to minimize its cost and maximize its utility by designing a contract list that
the agents can select from.  Upon completion of the work, the agent is rewarded with its payout.

In Moral Hazard, the principal really has no idea what types of hidden actions that agents will take
to accomplish its work, so it starts with a down payment to the agents accepting their task.  The
principal attempts to evaulate the performance of the work through the interference of a noisy signal
in the network, but adjusts its payout on completion of the work to mirror the performance of the agent.

If I were to generate a crowdsourcing service/platform, I would most likely chose the Moral Hazard style
as users in the network will most likely be very transient in the social platform.  Gathering behaviorial
data will be unlikely as you will only be able to measure a small number of transactions to generate
a type to assign to the user.  It is much more cost efficient for the provider in this style of unreliable
agents to moderate their final payout.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. (9 %) Consider an adhoc relay-assisted wireless communication system. Following a contract-theoretic
modeling approach, who is the employer and the employee at each communication hop? Which contract-
theoretic model can jointly capture the phenomenon of information transmission and relay functionality?
What can be the effort and what can be the reward in this model?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an Ad-Hoc network, each node when attempting to transmit to a destination is assuming the role of an 
employer asking its neighboring nodes withing range to act as an employee and do some amount of work.

This network model is most easily be modeled using a combination of adverse selection and moral hazard.
Each node will be able to track the performance of its neighboring nodes, and keep their types in a list
so that they are able to generate a menu of contracts for them.  In addition, since the battery life
is a hidden data element, the action of actually transmitting can be thought of as a hidden action in this
scenario, so you can begin your transaction by rewarding a down payment to the nodes.  When the transmitted
data is acknowledged at the far end, you can reward nodes who participated with a performance evaulation 
and use that data to update the neighboring node types.

As a reward in this network, the employer node can accept more packets and relay them for its well behaved
neighbors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. (9 %) How spectrum allocation is performed nowadays by FCC? Is it true that a wireless provider with
high budget availability and limited wireless infrastructure and/or services will be always allocated the
largest portion of the spectrum? Yes/No and Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FCC will dsitribute spectrum via auctions open to the public.  Normally, the bidding process looks 
at the bidder's ability to utilize the spectrum being offered.  Part of the process of acquiring the
rights to utilize spectrum, requires presentation of the bidder's infrastructure and current utilization
of already allocated frequencies.  If it can be shown that a bidder is not in a position to take advantage
of the spectrum, the FCC will choose a different bidder to win the auction grant.

Competition and maintaining a competitive environment is also a consideration during the auction process.
The FCC will try and distribute auctions grants evenly so as to not prefer one provider over another, nor
give any one provider an advantage in a market based on the spectrum granted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. (10 %) What is the main difference between a game in satisfaction form and a normal form game?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A game in satisfaction form calculates sets of results/strategies for the players based on allowing the
players' utility functions to meet a minimum threshold.  A normal form game does not allow for this 
kind of solution, nor does it mandate that one even exist.

A satisfaction form game ensures that a solution allows for all players to accomplish a minimum of results
for their given set of strategies.  It is not required that all players in a normal form game receive
any payout regardless of the strategy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. (9 %) Consider a public safety scenario after an earthquake, where the citizens of a city try to communicate
over the wireless cellular network to reach out to their families and check if everyone is ok. What network
economics phenomenon will be observed and why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a very large percentage of users of a wireless network attempt to utilize the same network resources
at the same time, they can overwhelm the limited network resources availble to them in a phenmonmenon known
as the Tragedy of the Commons.  Networks are normally scaled to a peak usage value that is calculated
from the population of users of that network.  It is not an infinite network pool, and can only support
so many users before it runs out of power, frequency or data bandwidth for users.  In an emergency situation,
it is quite trivial for a network that isn't scaled for a disaster to be overwhelmed by a peak value
never before seen on a network, leading to the common pool of resources being denided to the majority
of users.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. (9 %) Consider a cellular communications environment with 5 users within the cell. We formulate the
optimization problem of maximizing the sum uplink transmission data rate (social welfare function),
under the constraints that the transmission power of each user should not exceed its battery availability.
The goal of the optimization problem is to determine the uplink transmission power of each user. How
many free variables do you have and which are those? How many Lagrange multipliers do you have and
why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this scenario you have 5 users each with their own variables, yeilding 5 multipliers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. (9 %) The WiFi providers and the cellular providers use the same economic models to charge the users.
True or False and Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
False.  These two network providers have very different usage patterns, based on the data rates used, 
distance the radios need to transmit and the coverage area provided by each network type.

WiFi providers are normally able to charge their end users via an access time charge.  If a user wants
an hour of access, they pay a fee for that hour regardless of the data they consume.  These much higher
data rates are very useful for airport or hotel access who service users at a short range.

Cellular network providers are normally able to charge their end users via a data amount charge.  If a 
users wants to download one gigabyte of data, they can buy that much data regardless of how much time it
takes to download that data.  Normally, these users require their data access to be much more mobile so
providers have chosed the price per data downloaded model to offset the much larger infrastructure 
required to service this network.
