-- Incetive Mechanism and Resouce Allocation for EdgeFog Networks Drive by MutliDimesional Game Theory
--- Increase Populatiry of Edge Computing
---- Adoption of a multi dimensional soltuion
-- Introduce Edge-fog model system
-- System Model
--- users, edge and fog server
-- Multi Dim Contract Base incentive design
--- capture user types across mutlipel dimensions
--- Ability to forward tasks categorizes the users
---- size, vs intesity, sensitivity
--- Uses characterization to generate contract bundles
-- IR vs IC
--- contract type will influence reward and utility
---- chose the right contact bundle, get the most reward
--- generate a virtual user type to characterize the user better
---- allows a slope variable to define the users unwillingness to participate
--- How does the system measure willingness(s) or characterize it?
-- Stackleberg game commences
--- edge server performs as a leader
---- given input tx power, how many bytes should be sent
--- Follower optimization based on number bytes on input
--- Garauntees one Nash EQ
