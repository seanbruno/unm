-- Choose a paper that applies to network economics
--- game theory, contract theory, network graphs, 
--- each person does 7-8 minutes summary per paper and preso

-- elastic vs ineslastic
-- wireless (close high bandwidth)
-- cellular (longer range)

-- lecture:
-- distance based path loss, slow log-normal shadowing, multi-path propagation
-- large-scale propagartion (distance, log-normal shadowing)
-- small-scale propagation ( fast multi-path fading)
-- rx signal profile
--- radio wave progation - power density diminished gradually
--- noise awgn (additive white Gaussian noise)
--- power profile tx 

-- path loss
--- higher freq w/smaller wavelen yeilds smaller gain
---- higher freq used in smaller distance
---- gain is unit less
---- channel gain is affected by what frequency you choose for what distance your communication path

-- shadowing
--- reflections, diffraction, scattering -> Shadowing or Shadow Fading
--- large obstical causing non-line of sight communications
--- PathLoss = Normalized PathLoss + zero mean Gaussian rando number = 20log(d) - 20log(frequency) + 10log(Antenna gain/loss/characterized data specific to equipment)
--- log-normal shadowing captures the impact of reflection/diffraction/scattering interference for calculations via a random variable.

-- multi-path
--- signals bounce and diffract causing multiple reception events
---- Extra copies can interfere if they arrive out of phase or enhance if in phase
--- timing of signals may lead to inter-symbol interferrence

-- Wireless Multiple Access Technicque
--- FDMA, OFDMA, TDMA, CDMA, CSMA
---- FDMA, TDMA, CDMA allocates a resource
---- FDMA -- chop up frequency bands and give them to the users
----- allows multiple user access via xmission on different frequencies
---- OFDMA -- partial overlap of frequencies to allow better utilization of bandwidth
----- each user can xmit on multiple channel (sub-carriers)
---- TDMA -- each user gets a time slot to xmit
---- CDMA -- each user encodes signal with a specific user code.
---- CSMA types, collision avoidance and resource allocation is on the handset/user
----- ALOHA random access -- if collisiion occurs, backoff for random interval and try again
----- CSMA users check for other signals before transmission (listen before talk)

-- Wireless Networks
--- 802.11 - wireless lan
--- bluetooth (wireless personal area network)
--- wimax
--- wan (cellular)
--- wireless RAN

-- Wireless Cellular Networks
--- large geographic area covered by radio, deviced into regular regions called "cells".
--- each cell is associated with a fixed location tx/rx base station.  
--- users can move between cells via handoff and mobility management
--- neighboring cells are operated at different freq bands to avoid interference
--- multiple cells will use the same freq band as long as the cells are far enough apart to avoid interference
--- most cell systems are 3gpp 

-- Wireless LAN Network
--- small area, high speed radio
--- AP vs AdHoc 
---- AP has central node for access to  all network resources
---- AdHoc allows users to xmit/rx to each other without utilizing central node
--- 802.11

-- Wireless Ad-hoc Network
--- ad-hoc needs to be able to deal with broken nodes and nodes that aren't there
--- 802.11 based
--- no infra to start with, nodes self-assemble network
--- limited range, might need multi-hop support to talk with all nodes in a network
--- every node is a router
--- first responders, battlefield applications for quick setup and tear down

-- Wireless Ssensor Network
--- No central access of base station
--- uses a sync node for data/control of data collection nodes
--- nodes can fail at any time and there is no fixed topology

-- Wireless Mesh Network
--- Everyone talks to everyone all the time
--- No central node
--- mesh clients vs mesh routers
--- type of AdHoc network where any node could be a router to the larger network
--- mesh networks grow as more nodes are added, unlimited resources can be added

-- Cognitive Radio Network
--- Enables access to unlicensed frequencies when such access does not generate harmful interference
--- senses available spectrum and frequencies via SDR techniques
--- can use a geolocation database to know where spectrum is actively used by licensees to avoid interferences.
