Wireless Tech and Users' Needs
-- wi-fi good speed, limited range
-- cell network wider range, lower speeds
-- 4g cell higher peak, but realistically lower user throughput
-- smartphone/tablets are hungrier for bandwidth and servicfes
-- streaming vide is very hard to get smooth playback
--- stresses the cellular network
-- at&t in the us have heavy congenstion in large cities
-- at&t iphone rollout sucked because of huge demand
-- tech is not enough to fix supply/demand problems
-- economics use helps guide decisions to work in a market
Econmics and Wireless Technologies
-- Econ of wireless network are very different from other industries due to uniqueness of tech and apps
-- Econ stronlgy coupled with the wireless tech
--- wi-fi tech can profide hig data rate in a short distance
--- cell tech provides much better coverage with a much lower data rate
--- econ models for wi-fi vs wireless are very different
--- Commercial wi-fi providers charge users based on connection time 
--- Cellular provider charge users for actual data usage
Wireless applications
-- QoS req
-- resource user/implicaitno on the network
-- price sensitivity
-- video stream needs high data rate and low delayr.  This is expensive
-- http/ftp fiel xfer doesn't have any latency, but needs reliable delivery with low error rate.
Deregulation of Telecom MArkets
-- dereg of telecom made the one public/private monopoloy break up 
-- multiple players in each market
-- wireless provider profit maximizes with tech and pricing to compete with alternatives and competitors
-- industry dereg makes more choice
-- user can compare and change provider/plan liberally
-- user can chose different providers for different services
-- service provider may no longer have complete control of subscribers.
Wireless Network Econ vs Internet Econ 
-- characterization of reources in wireless networks is harder than hardline networks
-- wireless specturm is measured in Hz.
-- network resources corresponding to each Hz of spectrum isn't easy to characterize
--- wireless data rate is stochastic over time due to shadowing, fading mobility
--- wireless rersources are spatially heterogenous, same spectrum used by same users who may be far apart
--- wireless data rates are affected by mutual interferences from each user
-- wireless users may have different attributes, utility function, energy constraints, efficientcy, channel condition
-- users' perf is high coupled to mutual interference
-- The interactions(noise floors, power & interference) depend on the wireless tech
--- random access protocols (aloha) couple users via their channel access probabilities (collisions)
--- CDMA via mutual inteference 
--- spectrum overlay in cognitive radio networks 
Introduction to wireless comm and network technologies
-- radio Propagations charactereists
--- Transmission of point to point
---- straight and direct (LOS)
---- reflection, refraction, diffraction, absorption, polarization and scattering loss paths
--- LOS propagation
---- sattelite to ground station, tv, fm/am radio
---- inverse square law power propagation and reception
--- Reflection
---- wave hits a boundary of a dissimlar media, causeing all or part of the wave to change direction back to the origin
---- attenuatin of the wave is a factor of freq, angle of incidence of the boundary and the nature of the wave medium 
---- its what happens inside a building (wi-fi)
--- Diffraction
---- partial bending of wave around a corner or edge causing loss of power in wave form
---- its what happens outdoors (cellular)
--- Scattering
---- radio waves breaking apart into multiple directions hitting an irregular surface
---- very reduced power level
