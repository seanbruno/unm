- PS vs PL side
-- PS can use 1GB of ram for linux
-- LUTs are 6 inputs
--- LUTS, flipflops, switchboxes for the most part of the game.
--- configuration memory will not be showing in Vivado
--- static for the duration of the implementation (power reset or reprogram)
--- MUX is N+1 inputs (each input and a select line)
-- SwitchBox
--- black box
-- Configurable Logic Box (CLB)
--- slice
-- Chip Level
--- Eventually you go out to "PADs"
