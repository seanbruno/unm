-- UAV VECN Deployment Trajectory and Hovering Optimization
--- Internet of Vehicles
---- UAV hub for comms as they can LOS from better positions
---- Pathing is hard
---- Pre-planning algorithm
----Deployment timing and traffic model
----- UAC VECN system
------ Command and Control station is also chargin station
------ What are they using for predictive taffic modeling
------ Did authors address different varieties of "data cleaning"
----Fligth trajectory 
----- Why road pathing and not free flight networking
----- UAV FT-GA
----- Genetic/Fitness style algorithm
----Hovering optimizat in the mission area
----- Minimize comms to UAV and ground station
----- UAV Hovering Algo 
----- Designed on OpenAI treasure hunter
