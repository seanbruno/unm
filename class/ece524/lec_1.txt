-- Common pool of resources but shared in a way that most get zero resources
Why Network Economics?
-- provide intro to micro-econ 
-- how pricing mechanisms influence the modern wireless industry
-- basic wireless comm tech and micro econ
-- social optimal pricing, monotpoly pricing, price differentiation, oligopoly pricing, network externalities
-- intro to convex optimation/game theory
Wireless Utopia
-- Ulimited spectyrum
-- wireless speed == hardline speed
-- heterogenious tech coxist together without interference
-- wireless users are reasonable
-- wireless providers maximize social welfare over profit
-- all of this is unrealistic
Wireless Reality
-- specturum is very limited and crowded
-- Comm speed is not as fast as hadline speed
-- heterogeneous networks interfere with each other and conflict
-- users interfere with earch other
-- growth of wireless use is huge
-- wireless providers maximize profit over social welfare
How will we address the wireless reality
-- advance of weireless tech
-- econ innovations
-- policy reforms
-- ecnomics can help to improve
--- the overally perf of the wireless net
--- the satisfaction levels for both users and service providers
Regulating the Spectrum
-- key reason for sutdying wireless network econ is to resolve tension between supply of wireless resouces and demand
-- radio spectrum is limited
-- wireless spectrum is tightly regulated/controlled everywhere
-- The traditional way of regulating the spectrum is static. Assign frequencies to a location/provider.
-- all spectrum licenses belong to govt identities and commercial entities
-- frequency allocation map of every country or region is public
-- new wireless tech and service are rapidly emerging
-- every new wireless commercial service competes for licenses 
Dynamic Spectrum Management
-- enable ulicensed wireless users to share spectrum 
-- many bands are not efficiently used
-- FCC is opening up TV spectrum as lond as users' communications are protected
-- Microsoft has built a test install in Redmond
-- Problems related to Dynamic Spectrum Management
--- regulators must provide enough incentive for licensees to share their bandwidth
--- business services must adapt to new model for spectrum managment
