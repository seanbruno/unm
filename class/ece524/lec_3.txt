-- Choose a paper that applies to network economics
--- game theory, contract theory, network graphs, 
--- each person does 7-8 minutes summary per paper and preso

-- elastic vs ineslastic
-- wireless (close high bandwidth)
-- cellular (longer range)

-- lecture:
-- distance based path loss, slow log-normal shadowing, multi-path propagation
-- rx signal profile
--- radio wave progation - power density diminished gradually
--- noise awgn (white Gaussian noise)
--- power profile tx 

-- path loss
--- higher freq w/smaller wavelen yeilds smaller gain
---- higher freq used in smaller distance
---- gain is unit less

-- shadowing
--- reflections, diffraction, scattering
--- large obstical causing non-line of sight communications
--- log-normal shadowing

-- multi-path
--- signals bounce and diffract causing multiple reception events
--- timing of signals may lead to symbol interferrence

-- Wireless Multiple Access Technicque
--- FDMA, OFDMA, TDMA, CDMA, CSMA
---- FDMA, TDMA, CDMA allocates a resource
---- CSMA types, collision avoidance and resource allocation is on the handset/user

-- Wireless Networks
--- 802.11

-- Wireless Ad-hoc Network
--- ad-hoc needs to be able to deal with broken nodes and nodes that aren't there

-- Wireless Ssensor Network
--- No central access of base station
--- does use a sync node

-- Wireless Mesh Network
--- Everyone talks to everyone all the time
--- No central node

-- Cognitive Radio Network
---
