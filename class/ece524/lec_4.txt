--- Radio Resource Managerment
---- system to control reources maximize efficiency, minimize jitter, minimize interferences
---- centralized vs decentralized  management
---- utilize the lmiited radio specturm, frequency, interference
---- Power Control
----- most power is managed at the handset
----- CDMA differentiates users based on unique codes, power control was a huge problem with multiple units
----- prolong battery life of end devices
----- cell networks based on FDMA tech 
---- Channel Allocation
----- Chop of Freq into parts is either centralized(towers/base stations) or distributed(handesets)
----- Fixed channel allocation is easiest but wastes unused resources if not enough users
------ Easiest to allocate and its always available
----- Dynamic Channel Allocation requires more overhead to let more or less bandwidth be allocated
------ Orthognal Frequency Dynamic Multiple Access lets subchannels be managed and then moved around
------ Get the channel gain formula and commit it to memory
----- Admission Control Management
------ Moving users to different cell towers based on utilization 
------ Algos for these mechanism are much more advanced and they are pushed down to the clients to decide
------ Service and service class determines QoS (elastic vs inelastic)
------ Real time vs non-realtime

-- Supply/Demand
--- Market Demand Functions
---- Demand for Product: Function of Price of the Product
----- Price goes down, demand goes up
----- Cap based pricing in the Cellular Market 
---- Demand for product can be affected/disrupted by new tech
--- Market Supply Functions
---- Supply of Product:  Function of Price and ability to physically produce
----- Cost of raw material impacts end cost and can lower supply
--- Market Equilibrium Price
---- Intersection of supply/demand and consumer/supplier costs
--- Market Basket & Indifference Curve
---- Multiple products can be on the same indifference curve because they have the same utility
---- You can get higher utility if the customer budget is higher
--- Consumer Consumption Problem
---- Consumer wants more "Utility" for budget
---- Producer wants more money for "Utility"
---- Derivitive of the indifference curve will capture the 
-- Oligopoloy/Monopoloy Scenario
-- distributed contracts game theory
