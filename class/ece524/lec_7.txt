-- Shadown Price
--- Interpretation in terms of economics:
---- investments on n different resources: x
----- -p^2(x) will demonstrate profit
---- When n is close to 0, max profit, when it moves away from 0, max cost
--- The dual prblem may have less dimension or simpler constraints that the original(primal)
--- The Dual func may not be differentiable (non continuous/discrete)
-- How yto solve a Dual Problem
--- subgradient method
---- given a convex fucntion 
----- a subgradient d of the dual func g() at a dual feasible pnt satisfies 
-- Resource alloc for Wireless Video Streaming
--- The voice caller performance (SINR) can be used for perturbing parameter in solving optimization
--- Solution Framework
---- avg resource allocation:  constrained network opimation problem, which explotins the multiuser content diversity to efficiently utilize the network resoruces.
---- video source adaptation: each video slows down/speeds up by solving a localized op
