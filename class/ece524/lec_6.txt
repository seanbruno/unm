-- 1st and 2nd order conditions for convex function
--- Derivative/gradietn of fucntion 

--- 2nd order function
---- strictly concave > 0
--- Operations Perserving Convexity of Functions
---- non-negative weighter sums --> convext
---- composition with an offine mapping
---- point-wise maximum
--- Covex Optimization
---- Mathematical Optimaztion Problems

--- Unconsgtrined convex Optimation
---- feasible point is globa iff iterative methods always return 0 diff from previous
--- Two widely used methods for gradient-based
---- Gradient based
---- Newtons' method

--- Constrained Convex Optimization
---- feasible point x is global minimizer iff 

--- Langrangian Duality
---- optimzation problem can be coverted
---- yeilds a lower bound to original problme
---- if original problem is convex & 
--- estimates how far off you could be

--- Dual fucntion
---- minimum value of the langrangian over x
---- dual fucntion is always concave
---- tuning langrange multiplier

--- Langrange Dual Problem
---- minimize dual problem solution
---- duality gap will show how distance between objective function and dual fucntion
---- strong duality

--- Complementary Slackness
---- strong duality KKT conditions

--- KKT Optimality Conditions

--- Perturbing Parameter
---- Langrange multipleirs:  prices (for example)
---- min f(x) -- subject to something changing
