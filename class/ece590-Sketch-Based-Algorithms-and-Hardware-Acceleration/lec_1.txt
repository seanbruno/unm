- VLSI Lab
-- paralell processing of image at the sensor level
--- simultaneous processing of image data at huge processing parallelism
--- generate histogram from image data extremely quickly and ignores storage data/frame buffer
- Streaming and workign on large amounts of data
-- Large peak power during operation
-- bound by memory use and bandwidth to memory
- Streaming algorythms
-- only look at incoming data bits once
-- no storage of streaming data
-- only stores resultant solutions on bits streams
- Sketches
-- Space-efficient probabilistic data structure
-- Estimate peperites of data stream with statistically guarunteed error bounds
-- sublinear memory requirements
-- Fined grained parallelism can be explotited byt he hardware
-- used in Frequency estimate, cardinality, similariey, heavy change or occurance, quantile estimation
- counting ektches
-- generate counters that are assigned by a hash function to quickly map elements to a counter/bucket
- cardinatlity skettches
-- estimate cardinality via harmonic mean functions
- Ex 1 Empirical entropy estimation
-- characerize dataset, detect anomolies, campare dataset
-- estimate using top-K flows
-- accelerator architecture
--- Countmin-CU to estimate freq mi
--- 16k 8 counters
--- hyperloglog to estimage cardinality
---- 8k 4-bit buckets 
--- priority queu to select and store top-K freq
- Ex 2 Genomic similarity
-- compare genome via Jaccard similarity
-- each genome is a set of overlapping strings
-- Algorithym: gehome processing
--- (amazon FPGA)
--- Uses HLL sketches to compute cardinatliy
--- accelarator mem bus can xfer data from genomes in parallel
--- because of memory and input constraints, bus is 64 bits wide (8 inputs to 8 sketches 8 bits at a time)
--- calculation of merged data is not stored, just used for part of the accelerator
- Conclusions and Future work
