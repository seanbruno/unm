- Tabular Solution Methods
-- single state (special) bandit problems
-- Finite Markov decision processes.  Bellman equation
-- Dynamic programming
-- Monte Carlo
-- Temporal difference learning
-- some combination of these

- Evaluative vs Purley Instructive Feedback
-- Evaluative:  how good was the action taken, absolute value not comparitive
-- Purely instructive:  how good was the action in terms of knowledge of the environment

- k-armed bandits
-- multiple independant slot machine like things
-- each action for each machine is independant
-- how to balance exploration/exploitation

- Action-value Method
-- can't read this slide well
